Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[11] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[12] Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.
